Scenario: A hotel hotel chain is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to increased competition and poor management decisions. The managing director plans to adopt "Business and Data Intelligence" to reverse this trend.
Situation: A hotel chain noticed a significant loss in its market share and wanted to address this issue.
Task: To facilitate data-informed decision-making, I developed an end-to-end dashboard.
Action: Using Power BI, I analysed data to track revenue by category, trends by key metrics, property performance, realization percentage, and several other KPIs.
Result: This dashboard enabled the Revenue team to regain their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.
